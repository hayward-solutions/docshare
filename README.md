# DocShare

A modern, secure document sharing platform. Upload, share, and manage your files with granular permission controls.

## Why DocShare?

DocShare was created to solve a simple problem: I need a private server to host my documents. It needs to support object storage, and it shouldn't be bloated with features I don't need.

## Features

- **Simple sharing** — Share files with individuals or groups in just a few clicks
- **Permission controls** — Three levels: view, download, or edit
- **Group management** — Organise users into teams with owner/admin/member roles
- **Document previews** — Preview Office documents, PDFs, and images directly in the browser
- **Activity tracking** — Know what's happening with file uploads, shares, and group changes
- **Audit logging** — Complete trail of all actions for compliance and security

## Goals

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for feature priorities and future plans.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open http://localhost:3001 and create your first account.
